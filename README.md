# vault-ca-demo
A demonstration of how to setup vault to be a CA authority, using Terraform.  There is a (blog post)[https://medium.com/@stvdilln/creating-a-certificate-authority-with-hashicorp-vault-and-terraform-4d9ddad31118] about how to use this repo.

The blob post and this repo need to be used together as there isn't an overview of how to use all the parts of this repo here.
